# Alternox: Unlocking Affordable Health Solutions

## Project Summary
In recent times, a substantial augmentation in the digitalization of data has been experienced in the pharmaceutical sector. However, despite the evolving terrain of medical technologies, the cost of doctors’ prescribed medicines pose financial nuisance on individuals – especially those belonging to lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Over the past couple of years, this concern has become largely ostensible, especially in case of medicines produced by certain pharmaceutical companies, where the cost of medicines and other healthcare products are conspicuously higher compared to others.
In order to address the underlying concern of cost differences of vital medicines, a comprehensive web-based application, using AI and ML based smart algorithms as the core mechanism, is implemented which apprises users regarding the economical and cost-effective substitutes to their prescribed medicines, having similar chemical compositions from affordable brands.

## Novelty of the Project
The novelty of Alternox lies in its unique combination of features that distinguish it from existing solutions. It employs machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) and Cosine Similarity to precisely match medications based on their chemical composition, and includes a comprehensive cost analysis which not only suggests alternatives but also highlights the price differences and potential savings for users. The user-centric interface allows users to tailor the search based on their specific needs and search parameters, making the system highly user-centric, setting a new standard in healthcare technology.

## Components:
User Input Interface: Accepts user-provided symptoms and preferences.
Data Processing Module: Cleanses and preprocesses input data.
Machine Learning Model: Trained on medical datasets to predict alternative medicines.
Recommendation Engine: Generates personalized medicine recommendations.
Output Interface: Displays recommended medicines to the user.

## Results
The implementation of Alternox yields significant and tangible results. Users experience a considerable cost savings on their medical expenses, allowing for better adherence to prescribed treatments without financial constraints. This increased accessibility to affordable medicines particularly benefits individuals from lower income households, leading to significantly improved health outcomes. In addition to this, by promoting the use of cost-effective medicines, the system helps to alleviate financial pressures on healthcare systems and improves their sustainability. Furthermore, the data-driven insights generated by the system offers valuable information on medicine usage patterns and preferences, aiding healthcare providers and policymakers in optimizing treatment plans.
All in all, Alternox not only benefits individual users but also contributes to the broader goal of making healthcare more accessible and affordable for all. With a principal focus on ensuring economic viability and potency, the Alternox system not only elevates patient’s well-being but also plays a significant role in the optimization of healthcare resources and their sustainability.
